/home/aahlstrom/.pyenv/versions/3.12.11/lib/python3.12/contextlib.py:105: FutureWarning: `torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel()` is deprecated. In the future, this context manager will be removed. Please see `torch.nn.attention.sdpa_kernel()` for the new context manager, with updated signature.

LlamaModel is using LlamaSdpaAttention, but `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` does not support `output_attentions=True`. Falling back to the manual attention implementation, but specifying the manual implementation will be required from Transformers version v5.0.0 onwards. This warning can be removed using the argument `attn_implementation="eager"` when loading the model.

We detected that you are passing `past_key_values` as a tuple of tuples. This is deprecated and will be removed in v4.47. Please convert your cache or use an appropriate `Cache` class (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/kv_cache#legacy-cache-format)
